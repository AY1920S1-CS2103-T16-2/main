<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modulo is a NUS student life application specially designed for busy and motivated NUS students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As busy student developers in NUS, we understand that it can be daunting to keep track of various
tasks and concurrently do well for exams. Modulo features a one-stop app to keep track of one&#8217;s timetable, finances and academic progress. It also includes a quiz feature that facilitates students with actively recalling their study concepts to improve their study outcomes. We are strong believers of passion and we believe that students with passion in their fields of studies can leverage on Modulo to be more productive and successful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it features an outstanding, modern, user-friendly GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 40 kLoC.</p>

<p>The Dashboard in Modulo Grades Tracker provides an overview of the list of modules to be taken with their accompany grades attained. It is also coupled with a statistical pie chart, degree classification, Cumulative Average Point (CAP) and Modular Credit (MC) displayed for student users.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="major-enhancement-code-add-code-command-and-the-primary-features-of-grades-tracker"><a class="link" href="#major-enhancement-code-add-code-command-and-the-primary-features-of-grades-tracker">Major Enhancement: <code>Add</code> Command and the primary features of Grades Tracker</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Add</code> was greatly enhanced to allow the student user to add new modules to Grades Tracker. The single command executes the codes to generate the pie chart, information display and degree classification. The person class had to be developed into module class. Whenever, a new add command is executed the 3 aforementioned components will refresh to show the updated information.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What it does: The CAP tracker allows our user to keep track of his/her grades, overall Cumulative Average Point (CAP), MC taken and the degree classification (also known as "class") the user is in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification: This feature complements the function of Modulo and is a highly cohesive fit for the product as an all-in-one application for NUS students to manage their life in NUS. Being able to track grades is crucial as motivated NUS students have to know their progress and the modules that have taken so far. For students in NUS who are well-concerned and motivated. The CAP Tracker allows students to keep track of their CAP and grades with ease. Moreover, there are no existing applications that facilitate such a need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highlights: The implementation of the CAP feature was challenging but satisfying. It required in-depth design considerations around the students and a good knowledge of the grading system in NUS. I had to sought for advice from the academic department on various guidelines such as the range of approved modular credit. Defensive programming means that constraint requirements have to be well-thought of. Moreover, the implementation also required an overhaul of existing commands and codes. The structure remains intact but the code required heavy refractoring along with new implementations for the new feature. The single 'add' command initiates a series of major operations that generates the CAP, displays the right degree classifications and generates the pie chart. The implementation requires knowledge in object-oriented programming, data structure and algorithms. Many classes are interlinked hence increased the complexity of the modification and implementation.</p>

<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The UI is revamped to a new design that features modern curved edges and shadow-like background panes. Borders are taken away to promote a more cohesive flow of content. The aim is to deliver a "less is more" simplicity concept. Much attention is given to the effects of having a grey-like background matching with the black fonts and white background. It is designed in a way to display the services that Modulo offers without ambiguity, in order to draw our users' attention and keep them on our site.</p>

<h3 id="minor-enhancement-code-find-code-command"><a class="link" href="#minor-enhancement-code-find-code-command">Minor Enhancement: <code>Find</code> Command</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The find command was not adequately powerful. It has a number of limitations such as not being able to work if the student user does not use very specific keywords that match the fields exactly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The find command is enhanced to search for keywords in module code and module title. The enhanced search returns any module that contains the keyword in the module code and/or module title.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Special attention has to be given to the implementation as find returns only matching modules to the user but it would have caused the various pie chart, CAP, MC and degree classification information to change. Thus, the implementation requires the developer to isolate the updates from this command.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="minor-enhancement-code-list-code-command"><a class="link" href="#minor-enhancement-code-list-code-command">Minor Enhancement: <code>List</code> Command</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>List</code> command became necessary as the find command returns only matching modules to the student user. Thus, the <code>List</code> command will allow the user to return to the full list of modules again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="minor-enhancement-code-sort-code-command"><a class="link" href="#minor-enhancement-code-sort-code-command">Minor Enhancement: <code>Sort</code> Command</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Sort</code> command was created to complement the feature of Modulo Grades Tracker. The Modulo Grades tracker first order the modules by the sequence that they are added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Sort</code> command sorts the modules in chronological order by the semesters that the modules were taken. The implementation requires knowledge of comparators and streams.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="minor-enhancement-code-delete-code-command"><a class="link" href="#minor-enhancement-code-delete-code-command">Minor Enhancement: <code>Delete</code> Command</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the Grades Tracker feature does not have indexes the original delete command became obsolete. The <code>Delete</code> command was modified to allow the user to delete any desired modules based simply by specifying the module code. This tremendously reduces the time needed to search for a module and identify the index if an index system is applied and when the module list becomes long.</p>

<p>Welcome to the User Guide for Modulo!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Modulo is an all-in-one student life application which is mainly targeted to NUS students. The app features four different functions which consists of weekly organizer, financial record system, quiz revision, and grades tracker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) might find using Modulo to be more straightforward than the usual Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. The application has the visual benefits of a GUI but stands strongly rooted in command line usage. Modulo does not require an internet connection to run so there’s no worry when the school wifi goes MIA yet again. The only time you need to be connected is at the start, when downloading the application. Look to <a href="#Quick Start">[Quick Start]</a> to find out how to get started on Modulo!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The features in <em>Modulo</em> are quite distinct and having minimal overlaps, each feature has its own data file to read and modify. The logic to execute commands are also handled differently in each feature. As such, our decision to have 4 components for each feature was to reduce coupling and allow flexibility in our implementations. This means that the same <code>add</code> command is now able to trigger a different sequence of actions depending on the feature the user is currently in. This architecture style allows each feature to be developed independently, free from the constraints set by other features. Each time a user switches to another feature, the <code>Ui</code>, <code>Logic</code>, <code>Model</code> and <code>Storage</code> classes will be replaced by that of the new feature.</p>
