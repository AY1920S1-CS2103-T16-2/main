== PROJECT: Modulo

---

== Overview

Modulo is a NUS student life application specially designed for busy and motivated NUS students.

As busy students in NUS, we understand that it can be daunting to keep track of various tasks and concurrently do well for exams. Modulo features a one-stop application to keep track of one's timetable, finances and academic progress. It also includes a quiz feature that facilitates students with actively recalling their study concepts to improve their study outcomes.

The user interacts with Modulo using a CLI, and it features an outstanding user-friendly GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 35 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *finance* feature
1. Allow 4 different types of entries (**spend**, **income**, **borrow**, **lend**)
2. Added *budget* component
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_
3. **Enhancement**: added *stats* component

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
