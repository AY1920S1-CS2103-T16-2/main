== PROJECT: Modulo
For the passionate.

image::modulo.png[][Modulo,50,200]
I am excited to introduce you to Modulo in this document. I have enjoyed building it despite the many
challenges and sleepless nights. I hope you will enjoy Modulo as much as I do!

== Overview (What exactly is Modulo?)

Modulo is a NUS student life application specially designed for busy and motivated NUS students.

As busy student developers in NUS, we understand that it can be daunting to keep track of various
tasks and concurrently do well for exams. Modulo features a one-stop app to keep track of one's timetable, finances and academic progress. It also includes a quiz feature that facilitates students with actively recalling their study concepts to improve their study outcomes. We are strong believers of passion and we believe that students with passion in their fields of studies can leverage on Modulo to be more productive and successful.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it features an outstanding, modern, user-friendly GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 40 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

The Dashboard in Modulo Grades Tracker provides an overview of the list of modules to be taken with their accompany grades attained. It is also coupled with a statistical pie chart, degree classification, Cumulative Average Point (CAP) and Modular Credit (MC) displayed for student users.

=== Major Enhancement: `Add` Command and the primary features of Grades Tracker

The `Add` was greatly enhanced to allow the student user to add new modules to Grades Tracker. The single command executes the codes to generate the pie chart, information display and degree classification. The person class had to be developed into module class. Whenever, a new add command is executed the 3 aforementioned components will refresh to show the updated information.

* What it does: The CAP tracker allows our user to keep track of his/her grades, overall Cumulative Average Point (CAP), MC taken and the degree classification (also known as "class") the user is in.
* Justification: This feature complements the function of Modulo and is a highly cohesive fit for the product as an all-in-one application for NUS students to manage their life in NUS. Being able to track grades is crucial as motivated NUS students have to know their progress and the modules that have taken so far. For students in NUS who are well-concerned and motivated. The CAP Tracker allows students to keep track of their CAP and grades with ease. Moreover, there are no existing applications that facilitate such a need.
* Highlights: The implementation of the CAP feature was challenging but satisfying. It required in-depth design considerations around the students and a good knowledge of the grading system in NUS. I had to sought for advice from the academic department on various guidelines such as the range of approved modular credit. Defensive programming means that constraint requirements have to be well-thought of. Moreover, the implementation also required an overhaul of existing commands and codes. The structure remains intact but the code required heavy refractoring along with new implementations for the new feature. The single 'add' command initiates a series of major operations that generates the CAP, displays the right degree classifications and generates the pie chart. The implementation requires knowledge in object-oriented programming, data structure and algorithms. Many classes are interlinked hence increased the complexity of the modification and implementation.

=== Major Enhancement: Ravamped User-Interface (UI)

image::images/CapUI.png[width="800"]

The UI is revamped to a new design that features modern curved edges and shadow-like background panes. Borders are taken away to promote a more cohesive flow of content. The aim is to deliver a "less is more" simplicity concept. Much attention is given to the effects of having a grey-like background matching with the black fonts and white background. It is designed in a way to display the services that Modulo offers without ambiguity, in order to draw our users' attention and keep them on our site.

=== Minor Enhancement: `Find` Command

The find command was not adequately powerful. It has a number of limitations such as not being to work if the student user does not use very specific keywords that match the fields exactly.

The find command is enhanced to search for keywords in module code and module title. The enhanced search returns any module that contains the keyword in the module code and/or module title.

Special attention has to be given to the implementation as find returns only matching modules to the user but it would have caused the various pie chart, CAP, MC and degree classification information to change. Thus, the implementation requires the developer to isolate the updates from this command.

=== Minor Enhancement: `List` Command

The `List` command became necessary as the find command returns only matching modules to the student user. Thus, the `List` command will allow the user to return to the full list of modules again.

=== Minor Enhancement: `Sort` Command

The `Sort` command was created to complement the feature of Modulo Grades Tracker. The Modulo Grades tracker first order the modules by the sequence that they are added.

The `Sort` command sorts the modules in chronological order by the semesters that the modules were taken. The implementation requires knowledge of comparators and streams.

=== Minor Enhancement: `Delete` Command

As the Grades Tracker feature does not have indexes the original delete command became obsolete. The `Delete` command was modified to allow the user to delete any desired modules based simply by specifying the module code. This tremendously reduces the time needed to search for a module and identify the index if an index system is applied and when the module list becomes long.

=== Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub, with a v1.3.1 pre-release after a major revamp of the UI.
*** Updated the GUI color scheme and command bar design (Pull requests https://github.com[#33], https://github.com[#34])
*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 46% to 49% (Pull requests https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/pull/166[#166]) Major components of the tests have to be refracted as the major classes of the addressbook have been replaced.
*** Documentation: Classes and methods are properly documented.
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/pull/159#pullrequestreview-314558487[#159]
*** Contributed to forum discussions (example:  https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/forum/issues/167#issuecomment-552096062[1], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/issues/161[2], https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/forum/issues/157#issuecomment-552096555[3])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/pull/46[Mortago], https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1920S1/addressbook-level3/pull/167[T.A.rence])
*** Integrated a third party library (https://o7planning.org/en/11057/javafx-tooltip-tutorial[Tooltip]) for the pie chart animation (https://github.com[#42])
