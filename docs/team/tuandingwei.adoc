== Overview

Modulo (Level 3) is a NUS student life application specially designed for busy and motivated NUS students.

As busy students in NUS, we understand that it can be daunting to keep track of various
tasks and concurrently do well for exams. Modulo features a one-stop app to keep track of one's timetable, finances and academic progress. It also includes a quiz feature that facilitates students with actively recalling their study concepts to improve their study outcomes.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it features an outstanding user-friendly GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 40 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added *the CAP Tracker*
** What it does: The CAP tracker allows the user to keep track of his/her grades, overall Cumulative Average Point (CAP), MC taken and the degree classification (also known as "class") the user is in.
** Justification: This feature complements the function of Modulo as an all-in-one application for NUS students to manage their life in NUS. For students in NUS who are well-concerned and motivated, the CAP Tracker allows students to keep track of their CAP and grades with ease.
** Highlights: The implementation of the CAP feature was challenging but satisfying. It requires in-depth design considerations. The single 'add' command initiates a series of major operations that generates the CAP, displays the right degree classifications and generates the pie chart. The implementation requires knowledge in data structure and algorithms.

* *Minor enhancement*: Customised the find command to search for keywords in module code and title.
