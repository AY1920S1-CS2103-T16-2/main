[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]


`Main` has two classes called link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App covers the four features in _Modulo_ (Calendar, Cap, Quiz, Finance). All the features have the very similar structure, each consisting of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1` when in the feature _Module_.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/calendar/Ui.java[`Ui.java` (calendar)], link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/cap/Ui.java[`Ui.java` (cap)], link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/quiz/Ui.java[`Ui.java` (quiz)], link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/finance/Ui.java[`Ui.java` (finance)]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `XYZListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. Each feature in _Modulo_ (represented generically in the class diagram with `XYZ`) has their own UI component, largely with the same structure but mainly differing in classes `XYZPanel` and `XYZCard` to better present the information associated with the feature.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component for the feature _Cap_
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/calendar/Logic.java[`Logic.java` (calendar)],
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/cap/Logic.java[`Logic.java` (cap)],
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/quiz/Logic.java[`Logic.java` (quiz)],
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/finance/Logic.java[`Logic.java` (finance)]

The example below is in the context of the feature _Cap_ but all four  features in _Modulo_ have the same structure for their Logic components.

.  `Logic` uses the `CapLogParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call, in the context of another feature of the APP, _Calendar_.

NOTE: The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Cap Model Component
image::CapModelClassDiagram.png[]

.Structure of the Model Component for the feature Finance
image::FinanceModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/calendar/CalendarModel.java[`CalendarModel.java` (calendar)], link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/cap/Model.java[`Model.java` (cap)],
link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/quiz/Model.java[`Model.java` (quiz)], link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/finance/Model.java[`Model.java` (finance)]

Due to the different nature and behaviour of each feature in _Modulo_ dealing with different kinds of information (e.g. tasks, modules, quiz questions, finance logs etc), `Model` components between the feature can look very different. However, they do share some similar structures as mentioned below.

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the data for the feature (e.g. Calendar Data, Cap Module Log, Quiz book, Finance Log).
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<{Object used in Feature}>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component for the feature _Finance_
image::FinanceStorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/calendar/Storage.java[`Storage.java` (calendar)], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/cap/Storage.java[`Storage.java` (cap)], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/quiz/Storage.java[`Storage.java` (quiz)], https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103-T16-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/finance/Storage.java[`Storage.java` (finance)]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the data used in each feature in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== Calendar

==== Calendar week change
===== Implementation

Calendar week change is done by removing all tasks from the calendar and adding all the tasks that either have the new
corresponding week number or is an instance of `ModuleTask`.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How `go WEEK_NUMBER` executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Save all data in a single json file.
** Pros: No need to switch storage file.
** Cons: Unnecessary reading of data from other weeks. Need to add filter to get only the relevant data.
* **Alternative 2:** Read and load for each week from separate json storage file.
** Pros: Easy to clear data from a certain week.
** Cons: Need to switch storage file each time the user go to the next/previous week.

==== Persistent `ModuleTask`
===== Implementation

.Structure of the Model Component for the feature Calendar
image::CalendarModelClassDiagram.png[]

The abstract class `Task` has two subclasses: `ToDoTask` and `ModuleTask`. `ToDoTask` only exists in its corresponding
week while `ModuleTask` is persistent. When a `ModuleTask` is added to any arbitrary week, it would be automatically
added to all of the other weeks and when a certain week is cleared using the `clearweek` command, it would not affect
the `ModuleTask`. Hence, `ModuleTask` can only be deleted by using the command `clear` or deleting each `ModuleTask`
manually using `delete`.

===== Design consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice): ** Create separate classes for `ToDoTask` and `ModuleTask` that both inherits from
the abstract class `Task`. User use different command `add` and `addmod` to create the corresponding subclass.
** Pros: Code looks cleaner. Easier to implement a different UI for each subclass.
** Cons: More code.
* **Alternative 2: ** Use a non-abstract class `Task` for both ToDos and Modules and add a boolean field `isPersistent`.
** Pros: No need to add new classes.
** Cons: User needs to input an extra field `<persist> [TRUE/FALSE]`. It is more difficult to differentiate the
type of `Task` when reading the code.

==== Sorting
===== Implementation

`Task` can be sorted according to `TaskTitle`, `TaskDeadline`, or `TaskTime`. Each type of sorting has its own
comparator implemented in a method that would return a sorted `FilteredList<Task>`.

===== Design consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice): **Use an external comparator.
** Pros: Easy to switch between different sort type.
** Cons: Need to call the sort method each time the calendar is updated.
* **Alternative 2: **Set the `Task` class to implement the `Comparable` interface.
** Pros: Need to switch the `compareTo()` method of each `Task` each time `sort` is called.
** Cons: New/edited task would be automatically placed at the correct order.


// tag::undoredo[]
=== Quiz feature
==== Create question feature
===== Implementation

To use this feature, the user will need to switch to the quiz mode and add the question they want with
several requirements on the syntax stated in the UserGuide.

Given below is an example usage scenario on how to add a question properly and the mechanism that behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and switch to the *quiz* mode by executing `switch quiz`.

Step 2. The user executes `*add <qns>* _What is always coming, but never arrives?_ *<ans>* _Today_ *<cat>* _CS2131_ *<type>* _high_`
command to add a question with the question name: _What is always coming, but never arrives?_, answer: _Tomorrow_, category: CS2131 and type: _high_ in the quiz book.
The `add` command calls `Model#addQuestion()`, causing the modified state of the quiz book, after the command executes, to be saved in the `quizBookStateList` and shown in the UI.

Step 3. If the user realized that they have typed the wrong answer for a particular question, then the user can executes
`*edit CS2131, 1 <ans>* _Tomorrow_` command to replace the previous answer with the new answer with the given category and index prepend behind. The `edit` command calls `Model#setQuestion()`,
causing the modified state of the quiz book, after the command executes, to be saved in the `quizBookStateList` and updated in the UI.

Step 4. [Addtional] The user can execute `*comment 1 <val>* _The explanation is in pg 194 textbook_` if he/she now decide to add a comment or explanation of a quiz question at index 1.
The `comment` command calls `Model#setQuestion()` to parse in an additional parameter of comment into the entity of the question. It will then be saved in the
`quizBookStateList` and shown in the UI.

[NOTE]
Users can also utilize the undo/redo command when they realize that they have execute a command that they shouldn't do (Will be explained in [3.5.2]).

The following activity diagram summarizes the basic question creation process:

image::QuizCreationActivityDiagram.png[]

{empty} +

==== Undo/Redo feature
===== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedQuizBook`.
It extends `QuizBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `quizBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedQuizBook#commit()` -- Saves the current quiz book state in its history.
* `VersionedQuizBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous quiz book state from its history.
* `VersionedQuizBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone quiz book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitQuizBook()`, `Model#undoQuizBook()` and `Model#redoQuizBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedQuizBook` will be initialized with the initial quiz book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single quiz book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the quiz book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitQuizBook()`, causing the modified state of the quiz book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `quizBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted quiz book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `comment 1 <val> NewComment` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitQuizBook()`, causing another modified quiz book state to be saved into the `quizBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitQuizBook()`, so the quiz book state will not be saved into the `quizBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoQuizBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous quiz book state, and restores the quiz book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial quiz book state, then there are no previous quiz book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoQuizBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoQuizBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the quiz book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `quizBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest quiz book state, then there are no undone quiz book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoQuizBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the quiz book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitQuizBook()`, `Model#undoQuizBook()` or `Model#redoQuizBook()`. Thus, the `quizBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitQuizBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `quizBookStateList`, all quiz book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire quiz book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

====== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of quiz book states.
** Pros: Easy for new developers to understand.
** Cons: May suffer from performance issues on the memory (When a new command is executed, we must remember to update the list from `VersionedQuizBook`.)
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
